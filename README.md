A better way to learn new technologies as a beginner.

## How does it work?
As a new-grad who has experienced learning new technologies on/off the job, I have discovered a key mental blocker in the learning process:

> "Why is this \[tool\] significant, and how does it improve on other ways to achieve the same thing?"

It is only after you understand this that the specific design decisions or APIs for new technologies make sense. At the same time, it's hard to just _know_ this as a beginner, since you did not experience the "old ways" of this approach. 

If you're not convinced that this is a key mental blocker, try explaining why coders use `git` to a non-coder. They may say that zipping files & copying and pasting it between machines is a great approach to sharing work compared to the extremely complex world of `git`. But if you highlighted the difficulty of sharing code across organizations of thousands of different locations & machines, as well as the reality that software companies can make hundreds of code changes within a single day, then it should be easier to understand.

## How to use?
Type in a new technology that you're trying to wrap your head around, and let our platform handle the rest. We can provide you the context about why this technology exists, why it's popular/useful, what are common usecases, and simple code snippets to get you started. Hopefully, this will "unblock" your learning!
