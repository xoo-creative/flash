A better way to learn new technologies, in this ever-changing world.

## How to use?
Type in a new technology that you're trying to wrap your head around, and let our platform handle the rest. We'll generate a short (< 3 min) read that will teach you everything you need to know, starting with the context about why this technology exists, why it's popular/useful, key concepts, common usecases, and runnable code snippets to get you started. 

Happy learning!

## Why make this?
After surveying hundreds of software engineers during my many internships, I found that almost everyone's approach to learning a new technology is simply "read the documentation, find some examples, try some code, repeat". Many admit that they don't have a proper method, and just "try things until I think I get it". There must be a better way! 

Also, as many more transition into the tech industry (either from other industries or fresh out of university), people need proper learning approaches _specific for technologies_, ones that can help many beginner-level learners advance their skills. The method above only works if you already have strong experience in the field.

Having extensive teaching experience university-level computer science and data science courses, I condensed my knowledge and reflections into `Flash`, a new technology learning framework that will accelerate your learning and simplify your work, allowing you to become a better engineer, faster!
