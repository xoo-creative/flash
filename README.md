A faster and better way to learn new technologies, specifically for software engineers.

## How to use?
Type in a new technology that you're trying to wrap your head around, and let our platform handle the rest. We'll generate a short (< 3 min) read that will teach you everything you need to know, starting with the context about why this technology exists, why it's popular/useful, key concepts, common usecases, and runnable code snippets to get you started. 

Happy learning!

## Why make this?
[Software engineers need to learn new technologies constantly](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/t8qo2v/do_you_constantly_have_to_learn_new_stuff_as_a/). Given that there are [literally millions of libraries in various programming languages](https://www.codingem.com/what-is-a-library/), and new ones released almost everyday, we spend a lot of our time trying to learn and apply new tools.

But I found that many professional software engineers I worked with have a "brute-force" approach to learning:
1. Read the documentation
2. Find some examples on SO or Medium
3. Try some code locally
4. Repeat until you think you understand enough of it for your use

Not only is this an inefficient way of learning, it's also not scalable more junior engineers, since the approach of learning **relies** on your ability to parse dense documentation and "fill in the gaps" yourself (How could I learn a python package this way if I don't even know how to `pip install`?).

Having extensive teaching experience university-level computer science and data science courses, I condensed my knowledge and reflections into `flash`, a new way of learning on the job, helping you accelerate your work and professional growth, allowing you to become a better engineer, faster!
