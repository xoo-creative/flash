# flash ⚡️
The faster and proper way to learn new technologies, specifically designed for software engineers. Power by [`flash-agent`](https://github.com/xoo-creative/flash-agent/tree/main), a parallelized, multi-agent AWS Lambda built with [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain).

## How does it work?
Type in a new technology that you're trying to wrap your head around, and let our platform handle the rest. We'll generate a short (< 3 min) read that will teach you everything you need to know, starting with the context about why this technology exists, why it's popular/useful, key concepts, common usecases, and a self-contained and practical code example to get you started. 

### Examples
Feel free to check out our text-based examples, ordered by your current experience level. Obviously, the optimal experience would be if you had not used this technology before, but that is not required to enjoy `flash`.
- Beginner: [Git](./flash/text-examples/git/) 
- Intermediate: [Docker](./flash/text-examples/docker/)
- Intermediate-Advanced: [Elm](./flash/text-examples/elm/)
- ... More to come!
  
## Why make this?
[Software engineers need to learn new technologies constantly](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/t8qo2v/do_you_constantly_have_to_learn_new_stuff_as_a/). Given that there are [literally millions of libraries in various programming languages](https://www.codingem.com/what-is-a-library/) (this doesn't even count technologies and frameworks), and new things being released almost everyday, we spend **a lot** of our time trying to learn and apply new tools.

But I found that many professional software engineers I worked with have a "brute-force" approach to learning:
1. Read the documentation
2. Find some examples on Stack overflow or Medium
3. Try some code locally 
4. Repeat until (you think) you understand enough of it for your use

Not only is this an inefficient way of learning, it also does not work for engineers newer to the field, since this approach **relies** on parsing dense, technical documentation and "filling in the gaps" yourself. How could I learn a python package this way if I don't even know how to `pip install`?

Having extensive teaching experience university-level computer science and data science courses, I condensed my knowledge and reflections into `flash` - a new way to learn technologies on the job and accelerate your work and professional growth!
