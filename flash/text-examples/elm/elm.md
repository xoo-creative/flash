# Elm
 
## Onboarding

### What problem does this aim to solve?

Elm is a functional programming language that aims to solve the challenges of building reliable and maintainable web applications. Traditional JavaScript frameworks often suffer from issues such as runtime errors, unpredictable behavior, and difficulties in refactoring and scaling codebases. Elm addresses these problems by providing a strongly-typed, statically-checked language that enforces immutability and pure functions. This leads to more predictable and robust code, reducing the likelihood of runtime errors and making it easier to reason about and maintain complex applications.

### What sub-category of technologies is this?

Elm falls under the sub-category of "frontend web development frameworks" within the broader field of web development. It is specifically designed for building user interfaces and focuses on providing a functional and declarative approach to UI development. Elm is often compared to other frontend frameworks like React and Angular, but it distinguishes itself by its strong emphasis on type safety and immutability.
 
## Developer life with/without this tool

### Without Elm

#### JavaScript Development Challenges

Developing complex web applications in JavaScript can be challenging due to the lack of a strong type system.
Debugging runtime errors and type-related issues can be time-consuming and error-prone.

#### Scalability and Maintainability

As JavaScript applications grow in size and complexity, it becomes harder to maintain and refactor code.
Lack of a clear architecture and enforced conventions can lead to inconsistent codebases.

#### Example Scenario

A developer working on a JavaScript project encounters a runtime error due to a type mismatch, spending hours debugging and tracing the issue back to a small typo.

### With Elm

#### Strongly Typed Language

Elm is a statically typed language that enforces type safety, eliminating many runtime errors.
The compiler catches type-related issues during development, reducing debugging time.

Example Elm code:

```elm
type alias User =
    { name : String
    , age : Int
    }

user : User
user =
    { name = "John"
    , age = 25
    }
```

#### Predictable and Maintainable Codebase

Elm promotes a clear architecture and enforces conventions, making codebases more scalable and maintainable.
The Elm Architecture (TEA) provides a structured approach to building web applications, improving code organization and readability.

Example Elm Architecture:

```elm
type alias Model =
    { count : Int
    }

type Msg
    = Increment
    | Decrement

update : Msg -> Model -> Model
update msg model =
    case msg of
        Increment ->
            { model | count = model.count + 1 }

        Decrement ->
            { model | count = model.count - 1 }

view : Model -> Html Msg
view model =
    div []
        [ button [ onClick Decrement ] [ text "-" ]
        , div [] [ text (String.fromInt model.count) ]
        , button [ onClick Increment ] [ text "+" ]
        ]
```

#### Improved Collaboration

Elm's strong type system and clear architecture make collaboration easier.
Developers can understand and reason about each other's code more effectively, reducing conflicts and misunderstandings.

#### Example Workflow

A team of developers working on an Elm project can confidently make changes to the codebase, knowing that the compiler will catch any type-related issues.
They can collaborate on different parts of the application without worrying about breaking each other's code.
 
## Core Concepts

### The Elm Architecture
The Elm Architecture is a pattern for building web applications in Elm. It consists of three main components: Model, View, and Update. The Model represents the state of the application, the View is responsible for rendering the user interface based on the current state, and the Update handles user interactions and updates the state accordingly. This architecture promotes a clear separation of concerns and makes it easy to reason about the application's behavior.

### Immutability
In Elm, data is immutable, meaning that once a value is created, it cannot be changed. Instead, any modifications to the data result in the creation of a new value. This approach ensures that the state of the application remains consistent and makes it easier to reason about the behavior of the program. Elm provides built-in functions and syntax for working with immutable data, such as the `update` function for updating the model.

### Type System and Static Typing
Elm has a strong and statically typed system, which means that every value in the program has a specific type that is checked at compile-time. This helps catch errors early and provides better guarantees about the correctness of the code. Elm's type system also includes features like type inference, which automatically infers the types of expressions, and algebraic data types, which allow for the creation of complex data structures.

### Functional Programming
Elm is a functional programming language, which means that functions are first-class citizens and can be passed around as values. Functional programming encourages writing pure functions that do not have side effects and are deterministic, meaning that given the same input, they always produce the same output. This approach makes the code easier to test, reason about, and maintain. Elm also provides a rich set of functional programming features, such as pattern matching, higher-order functions, and function composition.
 
## Core APIs

### `elm init`

- Purpose: Initializes a new Elm project in your current directory, setting up the necessary project structure and configuration files.
- Usage Example:

```bash
mkdir MyElmProject
cd MyElmProject
# Initializes a new Elm project in the current directory
elm init
```

### `elm make`

- Purpose: Compiles Elm source code into JavaScript, generating a JavaScript file that can be executed in a web browser.
- Usage Example:

```bash
# Compiles the Elm source code in Main.elm into JavaScript

- Run the following command to initialize a new Elm project:
```
elm init
```
This will create the necessary files and folders for your Elm project.

2. Create a Simple Elm App:

- In the project directory, create a new file named `Main.elm` with the following content:

```elm
module Main exposing (..)

import Browser
import Html exposing (Html, div, text)


main =
    Browser.sandbox { init = init, update = update, view = view }


type alias Model =
    { message : String }


init : Model
init =
    { message = "Hello, Elm!" }


type Msg
    = NoOp


update : Msg -> Model -> Model
update msg model =
    case msg of
        NoOp ->
            model


view : Model -> Html Msg
view model =
    div [] [ text model.message ]
```

3. Run the Elm Application:

- In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory.
- Run the following command to compile and run the Elm application:
```
elm reactor
```
This will start the Elm development server.

4. Access the Application:

- Open a web browser and go to <http://localhost:8000>.
- You should see the Elm application running with the message "Hello, Elm!" displayed.

5. Make Changes:

- Open the `Main.elm` file in a text editor.
- Update the `message` field in the `init` function to display a different message.
- Save the file.
- Refresh the browser to see the updated message.

Congratulations! You have successfully created and run a simple Elm application. You can continue exploring Elm by adding more features and functionality to your application.
