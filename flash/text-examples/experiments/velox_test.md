# Velox
 
## Onboarding

### What problem does this aim to solve?

Velox is a high-performance data processing engine that aims to solve the challenges of processing and analyzing large volumes of data quickly and efficiently. It addresses the need for fast data processing in various domains such as data analytics, machine learning, and real-time data streaming.

Traditional data processing frameworks often struggle to handle the scale and speed required by modern data-intensive applications. They may suffer from slow processing times, high latency, and limited scalability. Velox addresses these challenges by providing a distributed and parallel processing engine that can efficiently process large datasets in a fraction of the time compared to traditional approaches.

### What sub-category of technologies is this?

Velox falls under the sub-category of "big data processing frameworks" within the broader field of data engineering and analytics. It is designed to handle the challenges of processing and analyzing large volumes of data in a distributed and parallel manner. This makes it suitable for use cases that involve real-time data processing, batch processing, and interactive data analysis. Velox integrates with other big data technologies such as Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark to provide a comprehensive data processing solution.
 
## Developer life with/without this tool

## Core Concepts

### Velox Database
Velox is a distributed, in-memory database designed for high-performance data processing. It provides fast data ingestion and querying capabilities, making it suitable for real-time analytics and data-intensive applications. Velox is horizontally scalable, allowing it to handle large datasets by distributing the workload across multiple nodes.

### Tables
In Velox, data is organized into tables, which are similar to tables in traditional relational databases. Each table consists of rows and columns, where each row represents a record and each column represents a specific attribute or field. Tables define the structure and schema of the data stored in Velox.

### Data Types
Velox supports various data types, including numeric types (e.g., integer, float), string types, boolean, date, and timestamp. Understanding the different data types is crucial for defining the schema of tables and ensuring data integrity and efficient storage.

### Query Language
Velox provides a SQL-like query language for interacting with the database. This query language allows you to perform operations such as selecting specific columns, filtering rows based on conditions, aggregating data, and joining multiple tables. Familiarity with the query language is essential for retrieving and manipulating data in Velox.

### Indexing
Indexing is a technique used to improve the performance of queries by creating data structures that allow for faster data retrieval. In Velox, you can create indexes on specific columns of a table to speed up queries that involve filtering or sorting based on those columns. Understanding how indexing works and when to use it can significantly enhance query performance in Velox.

## Small Running Example

This section provides a practical example of using Velox, starting from installation to running a simple application.

### Installation

1. Install Velox

- For macOS and Linux:
  - Download the Velox binary from the Velox website.
  - Extract the downloaded file.
  - Add the extracted directory to your system's PATH environment variable.

- For Windows:
  - Download the Velox binary from the Velox website.
  - Extract the downloaded file.
  - Add the extracted directory to your system's PATH environment variable.

2. Verify Installation:

- Open a terminal or command prompt.
- Run `velox --version` to ensure Velox is installed correctly.

### Code

Now that Velox is installed, let's create a simple Velox application and run it.

1. Create a New Velox Project:

    Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create your Velox project.

    Run the following command to create a new Velox project:

    ```bash
    velox new myproject
    ```

    This will create a new directory named `myproject` with the basic structure of a Velox project.

2. Navigate to the Project Directory:

    ```bash
    cd myproject
    ```

3. Create a New Endpoint:

    Run the following command to generate a new endpoint:

    ```bash
    velox generate endpoint hello
    ```

    This will create a new file named `hello.js` in the `endpoints` directory with a basic endpoint implementation.

4. Implement the Endpoint:

    Open the `hello.js` file in a text editor and replace the contents with the following code:

    ```javascript
    module.exports = (req, res) => {
      res.send('Hello, Velox!');
    };
    ```

5. Start the Velox Server:

    Run the following command to start the Velox server:

    ```bash
    velox start
    ```

    This will start the Velox server and make your application accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

6. Access the Endpoint:

    Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000/hello`. You should see "Hello, Velox!" displayed.

Congratulations! You have successfully created a simple Velox application and accessed an endpoint. You can now continue exploring Velox and building more complex applications.
