# Apache superset
 
## Onboarding

### What problem does this aim to solve?

Apache Superset aims to solve the challenge of data exploration and visualization in the field of business intelligence and data analytics. Traditionally, analyzing and visualizing large datasets required complex and time-consuming processes, often involving multiple tools and programming languages. Apache Superset simplifies this process by providing a user-friendly interface and a wide range of visualization options, allowing users to explore and visualize data in a more efficient and intuitive manner.

### What sub-category of technologies is this?

Apache Superset falls under the sub-category of "Business Intelligence and Data Visualization" within the broader field of data analytics. It is a tool that enables users to connect to various data sources, create interactive dashboards, and generate visualizations to gain insights from their data. This technology is particularly useful for data analysts, business intelligence professionals, and anyone involved in data-driven decision-making processes.
 
## Developer life with/without this tool

### Without Apache Superset

#### Data Exploration and Visualization

Developers need to manually write complex SQL queries to explore and analyze data.
Visualizing data requires additional tools or libraries, such as matplotlib or Tableau.

#### Dashboard Creation

Creating interactive dashboards with multiple charts and filters is time-consuming and requires extensive coding.

#### Data Access Control

Controlling access to data and defining permissions for different users or groups is challenging and often requires custom solutions.

#### Example Scenario

A developer needs to analyze a large dataset and create a dashboard to present the findings. They spend a significant amount of time writing SQL queries, creating charts using a separate library, and manually updating the dashboard whenever new data is available.

### With Apache Superset

#### Data Exploration and Visualization

Apache Superset provides a user-friendly interface for exploring and visualizing data. Developers can create charts, pivot tables, and geospatial visualizations using a drag-and-drop interface.

Example Scenario:

A developer connects Apache Superset to a database, selects the desired table, and uses the intuitive interface to create charts and visualizations without writing any SQL queries.

#### Dashboard Creation

Apache Superset allows developers to create interactive dashboards with multiple charts, filters, and drill-down capabilities. Dashboards can be easily customized and shared with others.

Example Scenario:

A developer creates a dashboard in Apache Superset, adds charts and filters, and configures interactions between different components. The dashboard is automatically updated when new data is available.

#### Data Access Control

Apache Superset provides built-in user authentication and authorization mechanisms. Developers can define roles and permissions to control access to data and dashboards.

Example Scenario:

A developer configures Apache Superset to authenticate users against an existing user directory (e.g., LDAP) and assigns different roles to control data access. They can define permissions at the database, table, or column level.

#### Example Workflow

A developer connects Apache Superset to a database, explores the data using the visual interface, creates charts and visualizations, builds interactive dashboards, and shares them with other team members or stakeholders. They can also schedule data refreshes and automate the generation of reports.
 
## Core Concepts

### Data Visualization
Data visualization is the process of representing data in a visual format, such as charts, graphs, and maps, to help users understand patterns, trends, and insights. Apache Superset provides a wide range of visualization options, including bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, and more. These visualizations can be customized with various settings, such as colors, labels, and axes, to effectively communicate the data.

### Dashboards
Dashboards in Apache Superset are collections of visualizations and other components, such as filters and text boxes, arranged in a layout. They provide a consolidated view of data and allow users to interact with the visualizations to explore different aspects of the data. Dashboards can be shared with others, enabling collaborative data analysis and decision-making.

### Data Sources
Data sources in Apache Superset are the underlying databases or data platforms from which data is retrieved for analysis and visualization. Apache Superset supports a wide range of data sources, including relational databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL, big data platforms like Apache Hive and Apache Druid, and cloud-based data warehouses like Amazon Redshift and Google BigQuery. Connecting to a data source allows users to explore and visualize the data stored in those sources.

### Slices
Slices in Apache Superset are individual visualizations or charts that can be added to a dashboard. Each slice represents a specific view of the data, with its own set of configuration options and filters. Slices can be customized with different chart types, aggregation functions, and styling options to present the data in the most meaningful way. Users can create and save slices for reuse in multiple dashboards or share them with others.

### SQL Lab
SQL Lab is a feature in Apache Superset that allows users to write and execute SQL queries directly within the application. It provides an interactive environment for data exploration and analysis, enabling users to retrieve and transform data from the connected data sources. SQL Lab supports syntax highlighting, query history, and result visualization, making it a powerful tool for data manipulation and ad-hoc analysis.
